# Amazon-Sales-Report

## Overview:

As part of my data analysis practice, I
developed a comprehensive Amazon Sales
Dashboard using Microsoft Excel. This
dashboard was designed to provide key
insights into sales performance across
different dimensions such as product
categories, city-wise distribution, and
state-wise trends. My focus was on
visualizing sales data effectively for
stakeholders to make data-driven decisions
efficiently.

## Key Features of the Dashboard:
- ### Sales Overview:

 The dashboard provides a high-level summary of
total sales (₹1,02,26,625), which is represented as
a key performance indicator (KPI). This allows for
a quick understanding of overall revenue
generated, ensuring easy accessibility to critical
figures without the need for manual calculations.
      
- ### Unit Sold
Along with sales, I incorporated the total units
sold (₹33,874) to offer an additional KPI,
helping to visualize the relationship between the
number of units sold and total revenue. This
data is crucial for understanding how
individual product sales impact the company's
bottom line.

- ### Product-Wise Units:
 A vertical bar chart shows product-wise sales
performance. Products with the highest unit sales are
visually stacked, making it easy to spot top-performing
items. This insight supports inventory management and
product promotion strategies.

- ### #of Cities Covered: 
The dashboard also tracks the number of cities
involved in sales (23 cities), helping gauge the
market reach. The percentage of active cities is
displayed to ensure a clear understanding of
coverage and regional saturation.

- ### City-Wise Sales Analysis:
A line chart was used to plot city-wise sales
across multiple regions, with noticeable peaks
in major cities like Delhi, Mumbai, and
Bangalore. This visualization allows users to
identify high-performing cities and potential
growth markets quickly.

- ### State-Wise Sales Distribution:
 A map was integrated into the dashboard to display
state-wise sales distribution, offering a geographical
breakdown of where most sales occurred. This view
helps identify geographical strengths and
opportunities for market expansion.
